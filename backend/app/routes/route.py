#describe : This code sets up a basic FastAPI router with a single GET endpoint 
# at the root path ("/"). 
# When accessed, this endpoint returns a JSON response indicating the service name, 
# its running status, and the version. 
# The APIRouter instance allows for organizing routes in a modular way within the application.
