\# Enterprise Document Intelligence System – Project Overview



\## 1. Purpose of This Project



This project is an \*\*offline-first enterprise document intelligence system\*\* designed to enable \*\*semantic search over internal documents\*\* without relying on any cloud-based or paid AI services.



In many large organizations, critical information is distributed across thousands of internal documents such as PDFs, SOPs, technical manuals, HR policies, and compliance files. Traditional keyword-based search is inefficient, slow, and often inaccurate, especially in restricted or offline environments.



This system is built to address those constraints by providing a \*\*local, secure, and intelligent document discovery platform\*\*.

\## 2. Core Problem Being Solved



Enterprises commonly face the following challenges:



\- Large volumes of unstructured documents

\- Keyword search that fails to capture semantic meaning

\- Restricted environments with limited or no internet access

\- Data sensitivity preventing the use of cloud AI services

\- Poor discoverability of internal knowledge



This project solves these problems by enabling \*\*meaning-based search\*\* over documents while running entirely on local infrastructure.

\## 3. High-Level Solution



The system consists of three major components:



1\. \*\*Backend Service (FastAPI)\*\*

&nbsp;  - Accepts document uploads (initially PDFs)

&nbsp;  - Extracts and processes text locally

&nbsp;  - Prepares documents for semantic indexing

&nbsp;  - Exposes REST APIs for document ingestion and search



2\. \*\*Mobile Client (Android – Kotlin)\*\*

&nbsp;  - Syncs documents from the backend

&nbsp;  - Supports offline keyword-based search

&nbsp;  - Performs online semantic queries when backend is available

&nbsp;  - Designed for performance and low-latency usage



3\. \*\*Intelligence Layer (Machine Learning)\*\*

&nbsp;  - Uses transformer-based embeddings

&nbsp;  - Enables vector similarity search

&nbsp;  - Runs entirely offline

&nbsp;  - Avoids cloud inference and paid APIs

\## 4. Key Design Principles



The system is built with the following principles in mind:



\- \*\*Offline-first\*\*: All core functionality works without internet access

\- \*\*Enterprise-safe\*\*: No document data leaves the local environment

\- \*\*Modular architecture\*\*: Backend, mobile client, and ML components are decoupled

\- \*\*Performance-aware\*\*: Optimized for low-latency document retrieval

\- \*\*Incremental evolution\*\*: Built step-by-step with clear milestones

\## 5. Current Project Status



As of the current milestone, the project includes:



\- A FastAPI backend with a stable project structure

\- Health check endpoint for service validation

\- PDF document upload support

\- Local storage of uploaded documents

\- Text extraction from PDFs using a local library

\- Git-based version control with clean commit history



Subsequent milestones will build upon this foundation.

\## 6. Long-Term Vision



The final version of this system will support:



\- Semantic search using vector embeddings

\- Efficient document chunking and indexing

\- Local vector databases for similarity search

\- Android client with offline-first UX

\- Clear architectural documentation and design rationale



The goal is to mirror the kind of \*\*internal document intelligence platforms\*\* used in large-scale enterprise environments.
